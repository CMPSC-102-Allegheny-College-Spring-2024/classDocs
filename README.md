## Course Deliverable

 + Due: 6th May, 9:00am

## Course Description

* Credits: 4

An introduction to the foundations of computer science with an emphasis on understanding the abstract structures used to represent discrete objects. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational methods and logical principles that they need to create and manipulate discrete objects in a programming environment. Students also learn how to write, organize, and document a program's source code so that it is easily accessible to intended users of varied backgrounds. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary algebra.

Distribution Requirements: QR, SP

## Learning Outcomes

- Justify the decision to select a suitable discrete structure for use when solving a problem with a computer program.
- Connect mathematical definitions, notations, and concepts of discrete structures to their computational representation by writing correct and efficient Python programs.
- Use the computational constructs of the Python programming language to perform mathematical operations.
- Correctly describe the properties of a given discrete structure and verify those properties through computational testing and/or mathematical proofs.
- Implement, test, and evaluate a Python function that performs data analysis using one or more sets of textual, numerical, categorical, binary, or combined data.

#### Categories

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following categories. All percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so presents itself, it is possible for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester.

|Category              | Percentage | Assessment metric
|:-------------------- | :--------- | :-----------------
|Class Participation and Activities | 20%   | check mark grade
|Labs                               | 40%   | letter grade
|Midterm Exam                       | 20%   | letter grade
|Final Project                      | 20%   | letter grade
|Total                              | 100%  |

#### Definitions of Grading Categories

- __Class Participation__: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required reading assignments, completing in-class exercises, asking constructive questions of the other members of the class, giving presentations, leading a discussion session in class.% and in the course's Slack channels.

- __Activities__: These assignments invite students to explore different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, programming, evaluating, and documenting real-world Python programs. These assignments will invite students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization. Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for instance, its efficiency and correctness. Knowledge gained from the class and the textbook will be integral to the completion of these projects. Unless other information is given about a due date, activities are to be completed by the end of class.

- __Exams__: The exams will cover all of the material in their associated module(s). The finalized date for each of the exams will be announced at least one week in advance of the scheduled date. Unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to take these exams on the scheduled date and complete the exams in the stated period of time.

- __Final Project__: This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated programming solution for a specific problem. Completion of the final project will require you to apply the knowledge, programming and technical skills that you have acquired during the course. The details for the final project will be given approximately a month before the project due date (during finals week).

### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the class and laboratory sessions. If you will not be able to attend a session, then please see/email the course instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation. Students who miss more than five 4unexcused classes, laboratory sessions, or group project meetings will have their final  grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. Students who miss more than ten of the aforementioned events will automatically fail the course.

### Assignment Submission

Your class instructor will be using GitHub Classroom to collect all assignments. It is expected that you are able to effectively use `git` to submit your work. If you require help, please see your peers, the Technology Leaders, or your instructor.

All assignments will have a stated due date. The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on that due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late. Assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. All late assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the session that is scheduled one week after the due date. The honor code (see below) is assumed for all submitted work.

### Late Submissions

All assignments will have a stated _due date_ and a _late deadline_ (the latest date that an assignment will be accepted -- up to a week after the deadline). The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on the due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late.

__Assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. After that time, the lab will not be accepted.__

__Please note, lab solutions will be discussed after the one week late submission deadline. Therefore, any submission of the assignments following that deadline will not be possible.__

### Extensions

Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, __no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.__ If you are requesting extensions for a lab assignment, then you are to email me with your request and also provide a _valid_ reason for your extension. This request must come before the due date of the lab and __not__ on the due date.

The decision to provide you with an extension (or not) will be weighed in light of fairness to your peers who are still able to complete their labs, regardless of their own busy schedules.

### A note on extenuating circumstances

If you should find yourself in difficult circumstances that significantly interfere with your ability to prepare for this class and to complete assignments, please inform me immediately so that we can work something out together! Do not wait until the last day of class to ask for exceptions to what is stated in this syllabus. In such a situation, you may also find it helpful to contact one of the available resources on campus:

- [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
- [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
- [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
- [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Communication

Various digital channels will be used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. It is strongly advised for the student to install the Discord app on their computer and smart-phone to be sure to receive all communications from the instructor, as well as, the other members of the class.

Additionally, the course website will be used to store the syllabus, course schedule and information about the `classDocs/` repository using the GitHub.  Your grades will be communicated to you by a Gradebook GitHub repository.

### Bring your own computer to class

The classrooms in the Department of Computer Science no longer provide machines for student use. You are to bring your own wifi-ready device to class to be able to follow along with course material. If the class is meeting online using Zoom, then please be sure that you machine is configured correctly to use these services to connect you to the class. As it is your responsibility to maintain your machine, please perform online research to determine how to configure your machine accordingly, or to install any necessary software to enable online meetings.

During the semester, you will be told which software to install on your machine to be prepared for class. Some of the prominent software that we may be using can be found at the following [resource](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/).

### Special Needs and Disability Services

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

Some of the resources on campus are listed below.

- [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/)
- [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/counseling/)
- [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
- [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)
- [Student Accessibility and Support Services](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/)

### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Course Catalogue.  The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project).  All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

_I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole._

It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, technical diagrams, proposals, paper reviews, presentations, and other items with their classmates or other individuals, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

More information about the code may be found at the [Maytum Center for Student Success](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/)
